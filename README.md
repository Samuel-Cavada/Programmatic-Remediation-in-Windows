## üìå Project Objective
> Demonstrate how to use PowerShell scripts to programmatically remediate common Windows 10 vulnerabilities detected through authenticated Tenable.io scans. This lab emphasizes automation for vulnerability management and patch remediation.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- **Platform:** Azure
- **OS:** Windows 10
- **Tools:** Tenable.io, PowerShell
- **Languages/Scripts:** PowerShell, Batch scripting

---

## üß† Skills Gained / Focus Areas
- Executed authenticated vulnerability scans with Tenable.io
- Scripted programmatic remediation for Windows vulnerabilities
- Automated the removal of insecure protocols, software, and services
- Validated results through follow-up scans and reporting

---

## üß™ Environment Setup
> A Windows 10 VM was provisioned in Azure. Firewall was disabled and registry keys were modified to enable remote administrative access. Scanning was performed via internal or cloud Tenable scanner.

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" `
-Name "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" -Value 1 -Type DWord -Force
```

1. [Step 1: Initial Setup](#step-1-initial-setup)
2. [Step 2: Configure the Environment](#step-2-configure-the-environment)
3. [Step 3: Execute the Scan](#step-3-execute-the-scan)
4. [Step 4: Programmatic Remediation](#step-4-programmatic-remediation)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Initial Setup
> - Provisioned a Windows 10 VM
> - Disabled Windows Firewall
> - Enabled local admin remote access using PowerShell
> - Configured an authenticated Tenable scan with DISA STIG Template

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Configure the Environment
> Created vulnerabilities on the VM:
> - Installed old version of Firefox
> - Enabled SMB v1
> - Enabled insecure SSL/TLS protocols using a helper script:
>   [toggle-protocols.ps1](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/blob/main/automation/toggle-protocols.ps1)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Execute the Scan
> - Ran authenticated Tenable scan
> - Verified detection of:
>   - Outdated Firefox
>   - SMB v1 enabled
>   - TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 enabled
> - Exported results for comparison

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Programmatic Remediation
> Used PowerShell scripts to remediate vulnerabilities:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\users\labuser\desktop\remediation-FireFox-uninstall.ps1"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\users\labuser\desktop\remediation-SMBv1.ps1"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\users\labuser\desktop\toggle-win10-protocols.ps1"
```

> Optionally used a batch file to run all scripts at once:

```batch
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\remediation-FireFox-uninstall.ps1"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\remediation-SMBv1.ps1"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\toggle-win10-protocols.ps1"
```

> - Restarted VM  
> - Re-ran authenticated scan  
> - Exported results for validation  
> - Deleted VM

## üìù Outcomes and Lessons Learned
- **Technical Insight:** Automation reduces human error and accelerates patching, especially for common vulnerabilities.
- **Configuration Skills:** Learned to manage Windows services, protocols, and registry through PowerShell.
- **Troubleshooting:** Ensured PowerShell scripts executed correctly and matched detection criteria in Tenable.
- **Takeaway:** Automated remediation is a key component of modern vulnerability management workflows.
